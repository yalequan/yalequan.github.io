## EDPSY 539 Classical Test Theory - A Reliability and Validity Study of EPDSY 490 Spring 2022

Performed a reliability and validity study of assessments administered to Spring 2022 EPDSY 490 students. The goal of this project was to determine if (1) The assessment was a reliable measure of the course content, (2) Determine what, if any, biases may be present in the assessment, and (3) Study the construct validity of the assessment and its underlying factor structure. Methodology primarily consisted of Exploratory Factor Analysis, Chronbach’s Alpha, and applications of Classical Test Theory methodology. Analysis was performed using R and SPSS.

## EDLPS 568 Evaluation of Education Policy - Evaluation Design for ESSHB 1546

A proposed evaluation of ESSHB 1546 (commonly known as Running Start) was drafted to respond for a Request for Proposals from The WT Grant Foundation. Our proposal suggested using a mixed methods evaluation consisting of qualitative and quantitative methods to evaluate how Running Start addresses the existing higher education opportunity gap and to suggest further ways to support historically marginalized students in Washington.


## CS&SS 544 Event History Analysis - Teacher Retention in Washington, An Event History Analysis

An analysis of teacher retention from 2017-2020 in Washington using data publicly available from the Washington State Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI). Specifically the OSPI S-275 datasets for each year were merged with other publicly available OSPI datasets to create a comprehensive public dataset of Washington teachers. Methodology primarily consisted on non-parametric modeling techniques including Life Tables, and using time-varying covariates and coefficients in a Cox regression model.

## EDPSY 591 Item Response Theory I - An Item Response Theory Analysis of Biology Freshman Survey

A psychometric analysis of a survey administered to incoming freshman at California State University, Long Beach who were admitted into the Biological Sciences major. The goal of the analysis was to determine if there is any significant difference between the latent trait estimates of students who were admitted as Biological Sciences Majors to CSULB in 2020 as compared to students admitted in 2021, determine if there is a significant difference in latent trait estimates between male and female students, and determine if there are any significant correlations between latent trait estimates.

## EDPSY 576 Multilevel Modeling - Predicting Growth Mindset

This project attempts to contribute to the literature on fostering growth mindset in students by using the 2018 PISA and focusing on the association between student’s perception of their school and teachers and growth mindset in the context of students in grades eight through twelve in the United States. Due to the hierarchical structure of the data (students within schools) survey data, a Multilevel Logistic Model was fit to the data.
