Hello and thank you for visiting my website.

I am a Ph.D. student in Measurement & Statistics at the University of Washington (UW) College of Education (expected graduation 2026) with Dr. Chun Wang as my advisor. You can learn more about our lab [here](https://sites.uw.edu/pmetrics/). 

My research passion lies at the intersection between applied statistics and education and is focused on issues of education inequality that exist in higher education. My two main statistical methodological research interest are the development and interpretation of multidimensional nonlinear latent variable models used in Psychometric models and the refinement and development of statistical models used to perform nonlinear multidimensional clustering with mixed data types. My educational research interest focuses on the use of psychometric and statistical models to identify educational opportunity gaps. I am highly skilled in the use of R and Python for statistical analyses. I am also experienced using the *EdSurvey* package in R for analyzing complex large scale assessment data including Trend Analysis, Latent Regression, and Direct Estimation of plausible values.

In addition to my methodological interests, I am passionate about educational and behavioral science research that promotes equity and social good. When Iâ€™m not working, I enjoy spending time with my family and friends exploring the outdoors.
