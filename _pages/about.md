Hello and thank you for visiting my website.

I am a Ph.D. student in Measurement & Statistics at the University of Washington (UW) College of Education (expected graduation 2026) with Dr. Chun Wang as my advisor. You can learn more about our lab [here](https://sites.uw.edu/pmetrics/). 

My research is motivated by the need for fair and rigorous measurement tools. To meet this need, my primary area of research focuses on developing measurement techniques that integrate explainable machine learning and artificial intelligence methods with cutting edge psychometric models to achieve accurate measurement of key educational constructs, especially tackling the challenges of high-dimensional variables and small sample sizes. My broader research explores barriers in K-12 education, with a focus on critical issues such as student belonging and chronic absenteeism. I also explore applications of psychometric tools to measures constructs in healthcare and psychological research settings.
