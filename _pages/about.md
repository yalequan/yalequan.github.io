Hello and thank you for visiting my website.

I am a Ph.D. student in Measurement & Statistics at the University of Washington (UW) College of Education (expected graduation 2026) with Dr. Chun Wang as my advisor. You can learn more about our lab [here](https://sites.uw.edu/pmetrics/). 

My research passion lies at the intersection of Applied Statistics, Psychometrics, and Education and is focused on issues of education inequality that exist in higher education, and the use of computer adaptive testing for high-stake assessments. My primary methodological research interest focuses on the development and interpretation of multidimensional nonlinear latent variable modeling and their applications to Psychometric models. My secondary research interest focuses on the refinement and development of statistical models used to perform nonlinear multidimensional clustering in education data and how those clusters can be used in Item Response Theory models.

In addition to my methodological interests, I am passionate about educational and behavioral science research that promotes equity and social good. When Iâ€™m not working, I enjoy spending time with my family and friends exploring the outdoors.
