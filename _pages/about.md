Hello and thank you for visiting my website.

I am a Ph.D. student in Measurement & Statistics at the University of Washington (UW) College of Education (expected graduation 2026) with Dr. Chun Wang as my advisor. You can learn more about our lab [here](https://sites.uw.edu/pmetrics/). 

My research is motivated by the need for equity focused measurement models that acknowledge and account for the intersectional identities of students. However, recognizing these identities often results in smaller group sizes which pose a challenge to traditional psychometric models. To meet this need, my primary area of research focuses on developing measurement techniques that integrate machine learning and artificial intelligence methods with cutting edge psychometric models to achieve fair and equitable measurement of key educational constructs in small sample sizes. My substantive research focuses on the application of psychometric and machine learning models to identify barriers to equitable K-12 education
