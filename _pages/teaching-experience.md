<p>
I design my courses to balance conceptual understanding, hands-on problem solving, and collaborative learning. I emphasize inclusive pedagogy and strive to make statistics and mathematics accessible for students from all backgrounds.
</p>

<p>
My teaching focuses on fostering critical thinking, encouraging active participation, and connecting statistical and mathematical concepts to real-world applications. I aim to help students not only perform calculations but also interpret and communicate results effectively.
</p>

<p>
I incorporate a variety of instructional strategies, including think-pair-share, group projects, modeling, and data-driven exercises, to engage students with diverse learning styles and to support equity in the classroom.
