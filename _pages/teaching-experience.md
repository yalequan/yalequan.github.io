<p>
I design my courses to balance conceptual understanding, hands-on problem solving, and collaborative learning. I emphasize inclusive pedagogy and strive to make statistics and mathematics accessible for students from all backgrounds.
</p>

<p>
My teaching focuses on fostering critical thinking, encouraging active participation, and connecting statistical and mathematical concepts to real-world applications. I aim to help students not only perform calculations but also interpret and communicate results effectively.
</p>

<p>
I incorporate a variety of instructional strategies, including think-pair-share, group projects, modeling, and data-driven exercises, to engage students with diverse learning styles and to support equity in the classroom.

### Basic Educational Statistics
* Held weekly office hours and assisted with grading and administering exams and quizzes. Responsible for managing course gradebook and assisting with course communication. Course content covers measurement scales, sampling distributions, confidence intervals, 1- and 2-group z/t/chi-square tests, and simple linear regression.

### Fundamentals of Psychological Research
* Teach up to 100 undergraduate students per quarter. Students enrolled in this course are either applying into the psychology major or preparing to undertake research within the department. Course content covers psychological research methodology and techniques. Topics include the logic of hypothesis testing, experimental design, research strategies and techniques, fundamentals of scientific writing, search and evaluation of research literature in psychology, and ethical issues in psychological research.

## Lecturer, California State University, Long Beach
*Department of Mathematics and Statistics*

### Statistics for Everyday Life*
* Taught large lecture and 1 activity section. Collaborated with a team of lecturers and professors to update course material and discuss learning objectives. Course content includes exploratory data analysis, methods of visualizing data, descriptive statistics, misuse and manipulation of data in statistical analysis, probability, binomial and normal distributions, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, correlation and regression, contingency tables.

## Graduate Teaching Associate, California State University, Long Beach
*Department of Mathematics and Statistics*

### Statistics for Everyday Life
* Wrote weekly lesson plans and solutions for all STAT 108 activity sections. Lesson plans consisted of a combination of think-pair-share, modeling, individual, and group work designed to extend student understanding of content covered in lecture as well as introduce new statistical concepts. Taught 5 activity sections with 30 undergraduate students per section. Students enrolled in this course were primarily pre-healthcare majors. Attended lecture 2 times per week and answered questions asked during lecture. Held 2hrs of office hours per week.

### Essential Algebra B
* Assisted with the development and implementation during the first semester this course was implemented. Developed lesson plans that connected the new Geometry material taught in activity sections to the Algebra concepts covered in large lecture. Lessons consisted of a combination of think-pair-share, modeling, individual, and group work. Taught 4-5 activity sections per semester with 25-30 undergraduate students per section. Students were primarily STEM majors. Attended lecture 2 times per week and answered questions asked during lecture. Held 2hrs of office hours per week.

### The Power of Mathematics*
* Assisted with the development and implementation during the first semester this course was implemented. Wrote weekly quizzes and developed lesson plans that focused on think-pair-share, and group work designed to demonstrate real-world applications of concepts covered in large lecture. Taught 4-5 activity sections per semester with 25-30 undergraduate students per section. Students enrolled in this course were non-STEM majors and came from a diverse population of majors. Held 2hrs of office hours per week.

## Mentor Supplemental Instructor, California State University, Long Beach
