<b>Research Focus

My research addresses fundamental questions about educational measurement and assessment in small-sample, many-group contexts:

<b>How can we design assessments and models that reliably measure student outcomes and support equitable decision-making when data are limited and highly segmented?</b> 

This question sits at the heart of my work and connects issues of psychometric modeling, predictive analytics, and educational policy.

## Research Areas

### Psychometric Theory and Methods

My methodological research focuses on statistical models tailored to small-sample, multi-group data.

<b>Current Work</b>

I am currently exploring methods to improve measurement and modeling in highly segmented or sparse data:

- Developing generalizable <em>multilabel classification neural networks</em> to detect differential item functioning (DIF) across many groups, to support equitable assessment practices.  
- Using <em>machine learning and Bayesian methods</em> for Q-Matrix estimation and refinement, to enhance measurement precision.  
- Comparing <em>frequentist and Bayesian approaches** for modeling sparse responses </em>, to balance data simplification with principled prior modeling.  

This work aims to create robust, scalable, and interpretable models that inform equitable educational decisions and high-quality assessment practices.
