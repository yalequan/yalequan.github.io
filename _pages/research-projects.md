## Teacher Retention in Washington, An Event History Analysis - 2022

An analysis of teacher retention from 2017-2020 in Washington using data publicly available from the Washington State Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI). Specifically the OSPI S-275 datasets for each year were merged with other publicly available OSPI datasets to create a comprehensive public dataset of Washington teachers. Methodology primarily consisted on non-parametric modeling techniques including Life Tables, and using time-varying covariates and coefficients in a Cox regression model.

## An Item Response Theory Analysis of Biology Freshman Survey

A psychometric analysis of a survey administered to incoming freshman at California State University, Long Beach who were admitted into the Biological Sciences major. The goal of the analysis was to determine if there is any significant difference between the latent trait estimates of students who were admitted as Biological Sciences Majors to CSULB in 2020 as compared to students admitted in 2021, determine if there is a significant difference in latent trait estimates between male and female students, and determine if there are any significant correlations between latent trait estimates.

## Predicting Growth Mindset

This project attempts to contribute to the literature on fostering growth mindset in students by using the 2018 PISA and focusing on the association between studentâ€™s perception of their school and teachers and growth mindset in the context of students in grades eight through twelve in the United States. Due to the hierarchical structure of the data (students within schools) survey data, a Multilevel Logistic Model was fit to the data.

## A Multivariate Statistical Analysis of Major Change Patterns and Significant Factors That Influence Graduation Rates: A Case Study at California State University, Long Beach (Master's Thesis)

Applied a combination of chi-squared hypothesis testing and correlation analysis to determine if students who changed majors graduate at a significantly different rate than students who did not. A Multinomial Logistic model was developed to identify significant factors that influence a students time to graduation. Fishers Multi-Population Linear Discriminate was implemented to develop a classification system which can be used to classify and predict a students time to graduation.

## Detecting and Classifying Suspicious Yelp Reviews

Analysis of the Yelp Dataset written reviews and star ratings using a combination of Tableau, VADER Sentiment Analysis with Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Machine Learning. Using VADER the sentiment of a written review was calculated and compared to the star rating. Reviews with negative sentiments and high star ratings or high sentiments and low star ratings were flagged as suspicious.
